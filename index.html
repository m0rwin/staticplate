<h3>State of project:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Header complete and responsive</li>
    <li>Menu complete with animations and responsive</li>
    <li>Footer complete and responsive</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Feel free to add to this document and/or the list above. Also feel free not to. I will keep it updated as I need to.</p>
<p>Breakpoints will not be some pre-determined values. Instead, we will make each page/section etc. respond to whatever breakpoint
    works/feels best.
</p>
<p>Notice how the header and footer (and the 2 different footer parts) respond independantly. I was reading
    <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/strategy/page-layout/defining-breakpoints/">
        https://responsivedesign.is/strategy/page-layout/defining-breakpoints/
    </a> and although we can't do mobile first (because the designs are not mobile first themselves), we can take on the
    advice to respond as we see fit on a case by case basis.</p>
